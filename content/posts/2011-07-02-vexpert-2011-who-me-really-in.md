Yesterday I received an unexpected gift from the people of VMware. **I've been awarded vExpert 2011.**

The vExpert program is the way VMware use to reward those individuals that have contributed to spread the word about the greatness of virtualization and have helped other people through the VMware Communities and/or through their personal blogs.

I was shocked when I got the notice and I want to thank VMware and specially John Troyer ([@jtroyer](http://twitter.com/#!/jtroyer)) that included me with such great group of individuals like Nick Weaver ([@lynxbat](http://twitter.com/#!/lynxbat)), Mike Laverick ([@Mike_Laverick](http://twitter.com/#!/Mike_Laverick)) or my friend and colleague at HP Calvin Zito ([@HPStorageguy](http://twitter.com/#!/HPStorageGuy)). My VMware Community profile now features the cool vExpert logo.

I hope to live up to the award :-)

Juanma.
