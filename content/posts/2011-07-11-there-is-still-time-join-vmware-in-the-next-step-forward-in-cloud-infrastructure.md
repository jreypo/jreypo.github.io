Tomorrow, Tuesday July 12th, VMware CEO Paul Maritz and CTO Steve Herrod will host a worldwide online event titled **"Raising the Bar, Part V"**. In this event they plan to make an announcement about the next generation of Cloud infrastructure.

There will be an online streaming of the event, five breakout deep dive sessions and finally a Q&A session by some of the most respected experts of the industry like Eric Siebert, David Davis or Bob Plankers.

The attendees of the online event will also have the chance to win a free VMWorld pass! How cool is that!

So remember, there is still time to join! Go [here](http://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/eventRegistrationServlet?eventid=319982&sessionid=1&key=82E09EE9B6FB6F29E31FB41998C23C79&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vmware.com%2F) and register because this is going to be huge!
