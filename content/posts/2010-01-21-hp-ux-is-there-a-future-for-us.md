Is there a future for HP-UX sysadmins? Is our beloved OS going to die like others did? For example True64 just to name one.

May be I'm just being a paranoid but I have to admit that I'm a little worried, specially after a post in [Olivier's](http://omasse.blogspot.com/2009/12/outcome-doesnt-look-that-good-for-both.html)
excellent blog, another one from Brian Cox in the [Mission Critical Computing Blog](http://www.communities.hp.com/online/blogs/musings-on-mcc/archive/2009/12/16/linux-vs-unix-shouldn-t-they-be-equals.aspx) about HP-UX and Itanium future and the RedHat announcement about dropping support for the Itanium platform in their future RedHat 6. Olivier commented that may be it is time to think about a change after 2015.

Currently there are no sings from inside the company suggesting the post-2015 scenario Olivier  is talking about, and of course as an HP employee my very well brainwashed and pro-HP point of view is telling me that we are not going to drop our major product for the critical mission market like Jacob Van Ewyk wrote in a comment to Olivier's post:

>"I know that at HP, we truly believe in a multi-OS strategy, although the pragmatic side of our business does realize that most HP Integrity server users, such as yourself, run HP-UX 11i"

I really don't know which one is the correct answer for to concerns, we will see how things develop in the future. If someone is really reading this blog and have any thoughts regarding this please share because I'm really lost.

Juanma.
