The last four weeks I had a bit of a crazy life, but finally the process has come to an end and I can freely speak about it.

It is with joy that I want to announce that by the 10th of May I will join **VMware** as PSO Consultant. It has been a hard decision, **HP** has been my home for almost ten years in two different periods and I leave here smart people, great professionals and more important very good friends.

From here I want to thank all my friends, managers and mentor at HP, this new path that lies ahead of me wouldn't be possible without you. I sincere wish you all the best.

Juanma.
