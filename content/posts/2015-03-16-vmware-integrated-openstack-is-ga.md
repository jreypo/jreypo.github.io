[**VMware Integrated OpenStack**](http://www.vmware.com/products/openstack/) was made available for customers last Thursday. It is a exciting time to be part of VMware.

Coincidentally with this announcement I have updated my original post about [VIO installation]({{< ref "posts/2015-02-02-a-first-look-into-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio.md" >}}) with new screenshots and information from the GA version of VIO and this post has been also published in our official [**VMware OpenStack Blog**](http://blogs.vmware.com/openstack/2015/03/16/vmware-integrated-openstack-first-look/).

Also if you want to quickly experience VMware and OpenStack all together there is a new [Hands On Lab](http://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/catalog/) available about VIO, the name is **HOL-SDC-1420 VMware Integrated OpenStack and NSX**.

Happy Stacking!

Juanma.
