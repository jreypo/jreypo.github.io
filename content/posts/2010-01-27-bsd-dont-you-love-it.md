Because a picture is worth a thousand words.

[![BSD](/images/bsd.jpg "BSD")](/images/bsd.jpg)

This is my laptop, an [HP 6730b](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/321957-321957-64295-321838-3955547-3687777.html "6730b") with a  Core 2 Duo 2.53GHz processor and 2GB of RAM, running 5 VMs with different flavors of [BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution "BSD") along with other applications. The VMs are running [**OpenBSD**](http://www.openbsd.org "OpenBSD") 4.6 (two of them, one with XDM), [**NetBSD**](http://www.netbsd.org "NetBSD") 5.0.1, [**FreeBSD**](http://www.freebsd.org "FreeBSD") 7.2 and [**DragonflyBSD**](http://www.dragonflybsd.org/ "DragonflyBSD") 2.4.1 and some of the other applications are [AIMP2](http://www.aimp2.us/ "AIMP2"), [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/ "TweetDeck"), MS Outlook and Console2 with a PowerShell tab.

The System Information window from [Sysinternals Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx "Sysinternals") is showing the amount of RAM consumed, still 300MB free :-D

Like I said BSD... don't you love it?

Juanma.
