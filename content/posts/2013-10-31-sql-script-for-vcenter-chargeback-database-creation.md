I thought it would be worthy to write a quick post to show the script I’ve been using to create CBM databases in customers installations. The original script wasn’t mine, honestly I don’t know who wrote it, and I’ve modified it to suit my needs.

Just remember to adjust the path of the files, its size, the usernames and password to your environment standards. Hope you find it helpful.

Juanma.
