I really can not believe it but a year has passed since my first ["Hello World!"]({{< ref "posts/2009-12-07-hello-world.md" >}} "Hello world!") post.

During this first year I received more than 25,000 visits, which to be sincere is far more than I expected. Below is a screenshot showing my top ten posts.

I want to thank all of you who have been following the blog. I also have a special thank to my dear friend **Jean Mesquida** who have been giving me a lot of feedback about many of my blog posts. I enjoyed to write every post.

I'm pretty sure the next year will be even better.

Juanma.
