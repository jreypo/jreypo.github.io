title: "About me..."
---

So you are wondering who I am. Well, I am nerd, that is for sure, and I am an engineer who likes to tinker with computers, software and electronics.

Professionally speaking, I have more than twenty-five years of experience in the industry as systems engineer, cloud architect and product manager, at Microsoft, VMware, Red Hat and others.

On the more personal side, my nerdy interests are computers in general, Unix and Linux operating systems, software development, systems engineering, and distributed systems. I also like to read about engineering topics, history, fantasy, science-fiction and philosophy. Oh and I really love skiing with my son during winter season.

Hope you enjoy the content, even if sometimes it takes me ages to publish a new article.

Have fun!
