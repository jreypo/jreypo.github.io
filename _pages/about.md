---

So you are wondering who I am. Well, I am nerd, that is for sure, and I am an engineer who likes to tinker with computers, software and electronics. Professionaly I have more than twenty years of experience in the industry as Unix, Virtualization and Cloud professional, currently working at Microsoft Azure engineering, in the Azure VMware Solution product group, as Senior Technical Program Manager, I've previously worked for Red Hat and VMware, amongst others, in their consulting organizations.

My nerdy interests are computers in general, Unix and Linux operating systems, software development, information security, networking, privacy and cryptography, and distributed systems. I also like to read about engineering topics, history, fantasy, science-fiction and philosophy. Oh and I really love skiing with my son durign winter season.

Hope you enjoy the content, even if sometimes it takes me ages to publish a new article.

Have fun!
