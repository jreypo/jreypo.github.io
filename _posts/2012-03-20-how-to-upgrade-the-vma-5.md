Last week **[vSphere 5 Update 1](http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/03/cloud-infrastructure-suite-updates.html)** was released by VMware, along with the main products some of the SDKs and automation tools were also updated, including the vMA appliance.

As you should remember from my [first post]({% post_url 2011-09-21-a-first-look-into-the-vma-5 %}) about **vMA 5** the classic `vma-update` utility is no longer available. So to be able to update our vMA to the new version we have to use the Web UI. Following is the procedure to perform the upgrade.

First access the web interface using `vi-admin` user as always.

[![](/assets/images/vma_vima_login.png "vMA login screen")]({{site.url}}/assets/images/vma_vima_login.png)

From the main screen go to the **Update** tab. In the **Status** screen click on **Check Updates**.

[![](/assets/images/vma_check_updates.png "Check Updates")]({{site.url}}/assets/images/vma_check_updates.png)

After a few seconds a message will appear showing the new update available.

[![](/assets/images/vma_available_updates_screen.png "Available Updates")]({{site.url}}/assets/images/vma_available_updates_screen.png)

Click on **Install Updates** and after asking for confirmation the update process will start.

Once the update process is complete the appliance will ask for a system reboot.

[![](/assets/images/vma_system_reboot.png "System reboot required")]({{site.url}}/assets/images/vma_system_reboot.png)

Go to the System tab and perform the reboot. After the reboot is done you can check the new version in the appliance console,

And in the `/etc/vma-release` file.
