Once again my colleague at HP [Eric Seabert](http://vsphere-land.com/) ([@ericsiebert](https://twitter.com/#!/ericsiebert)) has opened up the polls to elect the [Top VMware and Virtualization blogs](http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html).

This year yours truly is lucky enough to be on the list of candidates so if you feel that my work here have been of help I'll be grateful. However I'm a guy with his feet on the ground and I am perfectly aware that there are a ton of great blogs out there.

My personal Top Five are:

- [Virtually Ghetto](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/) by William Lam ([@lamw](http://www.twitter.com/lamw))
- [DoubleCloud](http://www.doublecloud.org/) by Steve Jin ([@sjin2008](http://www.twitter.com/sjin2008))
- [Nickapedia](http://nickapedia.com/) by Nick Weaver ([@lynxbat](http://www.twitter.com/lynxbat))
- [Scott Lowe's](http://blog.scottlowe.org/) blog ([@scott\_lowe](https://twitter.com/#!/scott_lowe))
- [Frank Denneman's](http://frankdenneman.nl) blog ([@FrankDenneman](https://twitter.com/#!/FrankDenneman))

Now go to <http://vote.vsphere-land.com/> and vote for your favorite blog!

Juanma.
