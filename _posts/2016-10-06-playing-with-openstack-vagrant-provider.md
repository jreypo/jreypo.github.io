Since [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is so tightly integrated in my personal development and learning workflow and my job basically revolves around OpenStack it was about time for me to combine both of them.

I have to admit that at first I did not see the value of using Vagrant to provision machines in OpenStack. OpenStack already provides me with a very powerful command line and web interface, cloud-init to customize the machines and with Heat I can provision complex environments with ease. However after playing a bit with it I can see real value on combining both technologies for testing and learning purposes.

## Anatomy of the Vagrantfile for OpenStack

Besides of the common options for any Vagrantfile there is a set of minimum options for the OpenStack provider as described in the [provider Github repository](https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider).

- `os.openstack_auth_url` - Keystone authentication URL.
- `os.tenant_name` - The tenant where we will provision our instance.
- `os.username` and `os.password` - The credentials for the above tenant.
- `os.flavor` and `os.image` -  Defining the flavor and base image for the instance.
- `os.floating_ip_pool` -  The IP pool for Nova assign the ip pool from in order to allow SSH to the instance.

There are other options that are mandatory if you ask me, like `os.keypair_name` and `config.ssh.private_key_path` that define the SSH key pair to be injected to the instance or `os.networks` which defines the tenant network to connect the instance to.

Below is the Vagrantfile I have used for my test in my lab Red Hat OpenStack installation.

```ruby
require 'vagrant-openstack-provider'

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.ssh.username = "fedora"
  config.ssh.private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"

  config.vm.provider "openstack" do |os|
    os.openstack_auth_url = "http://192.168.1.11:5000/v2.0"
    os.username = "labadmin"
    os.password = "redhat123"
    os.tenant_name = "starlabs"
    os.server_name = "vagrant-instance"
    os.flavor = "m1.small"
    os.image = "fedora-24"
    os.floating_ip_pool = "public"
    os.networks = "labnet01"
    os.keypair_name = "starlabs"
    os.security_groups = ["default","core_services"]
  end
end
```

## Provision your first instance

With our Vagrantfile ready, kicking off a new instance follows the same logic as always with a simple `vagrant up --provider openstack`.

I am planning on investigating more in deep this provider so you can expect more articles around this in the future. Also I have created a new [Github repo](https://github.com/jreypo/vagrant-openstack-samples) with the above Vagrantfile and will upload more samples from my day to day tests.

Courteous comments are welcome as always.
