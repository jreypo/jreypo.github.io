The **[HP Technology@Work On Tour](http://h41112.www4.hp.com/events/taw-2011/ww/en/index.html)** arrived yesterday to Madrid. This event has been a great opportunity for everyone to see the proposals from HP for [Converged Infrastructure](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/solutions/solutions-detail.html?compURI=tcm:147-300983), [Network Security](http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/index.aspx) and [Datacenter Transformation](http://www8.hp.com/es/es/solutions/solutions-detail.html?compURI=tcm:176-336501).

The event is not as big as the HP Tech@Work from other years or the [HP Discover](https://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2010/events/discover/vegas/index.php) that will be held in Las Vegas next June, instead HP in EMEA decided to bring a small show to several European cities like Paris, Madrid or Amsterdam and show there our stuff in all its greatness :-)

I didn't planned in the beginning to go to HPTAW2011, I really had a lot of work to do this week, but suddenly I found on Monday that **Hans Vredevoort ([@hvredevoort](http://twitter.com/#%21/hvredevoort))** was coming to Madrid invited as Press and I really wanted to meet him. Hans is a great guy and I like to chat with him on Twitter, he's also an [MVP](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/) and the owner of [Hyper-V.nu](http://www.hyper-v.nu/), one the top blogs about [Microsoft Hyper-V](http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v-server/).

We had the chance to share a couple of beers and have a fantastic conversation about the state of the industry, virtualization, blade servers, storage, HP 3PAR and HP products in general. We also made a small tour through the booth to see the demos and speak with some of my colleagues from HP  and from sponsors like [Brocade](http://www.brocade.com), [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com)
and [VMware](http://www.vmware.com). I want to make a special mention about my colleague **Simon Leech** from HP Networking who was very kind and talked with us about [HP Tipping Point](http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/products/network-security/index.aspx) security products

Finally I had the opportunity to take a couple of pictures of the booth and the almighty [Superdome2](http://h20338.www2.hp.com/integrity/w1/en/high-end/integrity-high-end-servers-superdome2.html) :-D

I don't want to finish my post without mentioning the people from the registering area, I wasn't registered to the event but since I was an HP employee they were so kind to provide me with the proper accreditation that allowed to enter the booth.

Juanma.
