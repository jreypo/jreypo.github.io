VMware has releasedÂ **VMware vSphere Mobile Watchlist**. It is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vmware.beacon&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vmware-vsphere-mobile-watchlist/id792869677?ls=1&mt=8), iPhone only for now, and will enable any system administrator to keep an eye on their most critical apps from their phones.

It is a very intuitive app to use, below are a series of screenshots from the app installed on my iPhone 5 and connected to my homelab vCenter Server.

From the main screen you can add virtual machines from your vCenter inventory to the default watchlist or create a new watchlist.

Once you have added several virtual machines to your list you can check them in a glance in list or grid mode.

Tap on a VM and you will access its details, configured resources, VM Tools state, related objects, etc.

As you can see from the screenshot this a multi screen so slide to the left and you can get a console screenshot of the virtual machine and perform different actions on the virtual machine.

I hope this is a step towards a new set of mobile apps from VMware focused on the administration of the different components of a virtual and cloud infrastructure :)
