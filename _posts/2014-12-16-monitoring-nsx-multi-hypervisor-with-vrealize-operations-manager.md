VMware has released a new **vRealize Operations Manager** management pack for **NSX Multi-hypervisor**. This new management pack will allow vROps to extend its management capabilities into any NSX-MH infrastructure.

This management pack provides a great set a features, including:

- Operational visibility into the different NSX-MH components, from NSX Manager to Controllers, transport nodes and logical elements of the network.
- Search and drill down functionality to help the administrator monitor the health of the NSX objects.
- Alerts and root cause problem solving capabilities by detecting configuration, connectivity and health deficiencies into the NSX environment.
- Report templates for NSX Multi-Hypervisor environment.

The management pack requires vRealize Operations Manager 6.0 and can be downloaded from [VMware Solutions Exchange](https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/management-pack-for-nsx-for-multi-hypervisor-1-0#.VI9wfIrF-n0).

## Configure the adapter instance

The first task is to create the credentials for the solution. Access **Administration -> Credentials** and create a new credential for the **NSX-MH Adapter**.It has to include the administration credentials for the NSX Controller, NSX Manager and vCenter Server.

On the pop-up window enter the IP address or the FQDN for:

Only the first NSX Controller is needed.

Test the connection, accept the certificates for the different components and click Save Settings. After this the adapter is configured and will start collecting data, it will take a some time until it displays data, depending on the size of the NSX environment, to have a full collection of data.

## NSX-MH dashboards

Out of the box the management pack comes with three dashboards.

### NSX-MH Main

It provides an overview of the health of the different network objects
