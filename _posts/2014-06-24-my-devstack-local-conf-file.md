One of the pillars of my personal OpenStack ecosystem is [**DevStack**](http://devstack.org/). For those of you new to the OpenStack world DevStack is a tool, basically is a shell script, that allows to deploy a full OpenStack environment, installing every required dependency. It is widely used amongst beginners and the development community.

My DevStack instance is a Fedora 20 virtual machine with 2 vCPUs and 2GB of memory, I use it mostly for testing and development. I have setup a small vSphere environment in Fusion with a vCSA virtual machine and a nested ESXi, both 5.5 version. The DNS and NFS services are provided by my management VM which is another Fedora 20 VM with just 512MB of RAM.

My `local.conf` file is no rocket science as you have seen, but may be it can be of help to anyone wanting to quickly setup a DevStack+vSphere development environment.

Juanma.
