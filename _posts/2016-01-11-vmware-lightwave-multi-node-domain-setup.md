[VMware Lightwave](https://vmware.github.io/lightwave/) is an identity and management access service for Cloud-Native apps. It was released to the community last year and the source code can be accessed in VMware's Github. Since I'm revamping my homelab to become more cloud-native aware Lightwave was the natural choice to provide authentication services, I decided to setup a multi-node domain to be able to test different Lightwave scenarios.

## Lightwave installation

First of all we will need two VMware Photon virtual machines with static IP addresses and unique hostnames, these will be our domain controllers. Then on each of them list the available repositories for `tdnf`.

```text
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]# tdnf repolist
repo id             repo name                               status
photon-updates      VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates  enabled
photon              VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)         enabled
lightwave           VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)            enabled
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]#
```

If the `lightwave` is not there we need to add it. Go to `/etc/yum.repos.d/` and create the file `lightwave.repo`, edit it and add the following content.

```ini
[lightwave]
name=VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)
baseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/lightwave
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
skip_if_unavailable=True
```

Then check that if the repository `photon-extras` is present and if not repeat the same process but with the below content.

```text
[photon-extras]
name=VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)
baseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/photon_extras
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
skip_if_unavailable=True
```

Install `vmware-lightwave-server` package.

```text
tdnf install vmware-lightwave-server
```

## Configure first domain controller

With Lightwave Server installed in both nodes promote the first one to domain controller. Provide the domain, in my case `lightwave.local` and the administration password.

```text
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]# /opt/vmware/bin/ic-promote --domain lightwave.local --password VMware1!
20160110184918:INFO:Setting up system as Infrastructure standalone node

20160110184921:INFO:Restarting service [vmdir]
Domain Controller setup was successful
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]#
```

Now that our fist domain controller is ready lets create our first user in the domain. For this task we will use `dir-cli` command, also in `/opt/vmware/bin` path.

```text
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]# /opt/vmware/bin/dir-cli user create --account jreypo --first-name "Juan Manuel" --last-name Rey --user-password "VMware1!"
Enter password for administrator@lightwave.local:
User account [jreypo] created successfully
root@lightwave01 [ ~ ]#
```

## Configure second domain controller

To configure the second domain controller we will use the same `ic-promote` command but with the `--partner` option to indicate the primary domain controller.

```text
rootlightwave02 [ ~ ]# /opt/vmware/bin/ic-promote --partner lightwave01.jreypo.io --domain lightwave.local
Password (administrator@lightwave.local):

20160111083348:INFO:Restarting service [vmdir]
Domain Controller setup was successful
rootlightwave02 [ ~ ]#
```

## Join the domain

With both domain controllers configured now we are going to join one Photon Docker host to the domain in order to verify the setup. First we need to install the client tools, configure the same `lightwave` and `photon-extras` repositories and install `vmware-lightwave-clients` package.

```text
tdnf install vmware-lightwave-clients
```

With the client tools installed use the command `ic-join` to join the domain.

```text
root [ ~ ]# /opt/vmware/bin/ic-join --domain lightwave.local --domain-controller lightwave01.jreypo.io --password VMware1!
20160111133217:INFO:Setting up system as client to Infrastructure node at [lightwave01.jreypo.io]

root [ ~ ]#
```

And we are done, in a future post I'll show you how to enable SSH access against Lightwave.
