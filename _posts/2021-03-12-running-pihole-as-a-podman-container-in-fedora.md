I run Pi-Hole at home to filter and block ad traffic, is a fantastic piece of of software that helps me to keep me and my son away from unwanted ads. It can be run on a VM or even better a [Docker container](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole). If you are not doing it yet I encourage you to visit [Pi-Hole homepage](https://pi-hole.net/) and take a look at the project and donate or contribute in [GitHub](https://github.com/pi-hole) to keep it running.

For the last year and a half or so I have been running pi-hole on a CentOS 7 virtual machine, it's been working great but I wanted to move it outside of my ESXi host and separate it from my lab workloads. Many people use a Raspberry Pi to run it and my original intention was exactly that and use [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) to manage the container like I was doing on CentOS, however I had a [GIGABYTE GB-BXBT-2807](https://www.gigabyte.com/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BXBT-2807-rev-10) mini PC laying around. This little fella used to be my media center, is a NUC-like machine with a dual-core Intel Celeron N2807 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 60GB SSD. It has enough room not only for Pi-Hole but also for other workloads I am planning to run to support my home network.

I decided to move from CentOS to Fedora Server so I installed version 33. Fedora 33 comes with a caveat, since it uses [cgroupvs2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) Docker does not work. But that is not the end of the world because it has [Podman](https://podman.io/) available instead, I've used it in the past for testing purposes but never to run any serious workloads at home, there are ways to install Docker in Fedora 33 but I decided to use the default option and try run Pi-Hole on it.

If you have never heard about Podman, or Pod Manager, it is a daemonless container engine for OCI Containers on Linux originally developed by Red Hat as an open source project and intended to replace Docker in the Fedora/CentOS/RHEL ecosystem.

## Prepare the server

Install Fedora 33 in a virtual machine or like in my case in a physical system, is up to you to decide the type of installation but for me minimal installation is more than enough to keep the system and its attack surface as small as possible.

After the OS is installed run `dnf update` to get latest Fedora updates and install Podman.

```
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install -y podman 
```

Next we need to adjust Fedora network configuration. By default Fedora Server comes with [**NetworkManager**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/) to manage networking and `systemd-resolved` service enabled, we will maintain **NetworkManager** but will configure static `ipv4` addressing, FirewallD DNS servers using `nmcli` tool and disable `systemd-resolved`.

### Set an static IP address

Modify your existing connection with `nmcli`, my connection is `ens192` but you should run `nmcli connection` to get a list of the existing connections and use the appropriate one.

```
sudo nmcli connection modify ens192 ipv4.method manual
sudo nmcli connection modify ens192 ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.94/24
sudo nmcli connection modify ens192 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
```

### Configure DNS

Configure DNS and stop and disable `systemd-resolved` service.

```
sudo nmcli connection modify ens192 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### Configure FirewallD

Configure [FirewallD](https://firewalld.org/) by adding rules to enable access to Pi-Hole TCP and UDP ports. If you want to know more about `firewalld` review my article [here]({% post_url 2015-04-08-firewalld-quickstart-guide %}).

```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=53/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=53/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=67/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=53/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=53/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=67/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=80/tcp
```

## Run Pi-Hole

Pi-Hole will need two container volumes to persist data, we can create them with `podman` in the same way as with `docker` cli.

```
sudo podman volume create pihole_pihole
sudo podman volume create pihole_dnsmasq
```

Pull latest `pihole` container image.

```
sudo podman pull pihole/pihole
```

Run `pihole` container to test that it works.

```
podman run --name=pihole \
--hostname=pi-hole \
--cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
--dns=127.0.0.1 \
--dns=1.1.1.1 \
-e TZ=Europe/Madrid \
-e SERVERIP=192.168.1.20 \
-e WEBPASSWORD=my_pihole_password \
-e DNS1=1.1.1.1 \
-e DNS2=1.0.0.1 \
-e DNSSEC=true \
-e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING=true \
-e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING_IP=192.168.1.1 \
-e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING_DOMAIN=lan \
-e TEMPERATUREUNIT=c \
-v pihole_pihole:/etc/pihole:Z \
-v pihole_dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d:Z \
-p 80:80/tcp \
-p 443:443/tcp \
-p 67:67/udp \
-p 53:53/tcp \
-p 53:53/udp \
pihole/pihole
```

You can verify that container running with `sudo podman ps`.

```
$ sudo podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND  CREATED      STATUS          PORTS                                                                                                  NAMES
3c0f7b90e121  docker.io/pihole/pihole:latest           2 weeks ago  Up 2 weeks ago  0.0.0.0:53->53/tcp, 0.0.0.0:53->53/udp, 0.0.0.0:67->67/udp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp  pihole
```

## Configure Pi-Hole as systemd service

We have verified that Pi-Hole can be run as a Podman container, however if the server gets down or we reboot it for whatever reason we will need to run the container manually again. In CentOS with Docker I had this solved by using Portainer, however since Portainer needs to be run as privileged container cannot be run with Podman. Instead I decided to create a SystemD service that will be automatically run during server startup.

Create your service unit file in `/etc/systemd/system`, I named mine `pi-hole.service`.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Pi-Hole Podman Container
After=firewalld.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --name=pihole --hostname=pi-hole --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --dns=127.0.0.1 --dns=1.1.1.1 -e TZ=Europe/Madrid -e SERVERIP=192.168.1.20 -e WEBPASSWORD=my_pihole_password -e DNS1=1.1.1.1 -e DNS2=1.0.0.1 -e DNSSEC=true -e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING=true -e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING_IP=192.168.1.1 -e CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING_DOMAIN=lan -e TEMPERATUREUNIT=c -v pihole_pihole:/etc/pihole:Z -v pihole_dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d:Z -p 80:80/tcp -p 443:443/tcp -p 67:67/udp -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp pihole/pihole
ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 2 pihole
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/podman rm pihole

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After creating the service unit file and before staring the service configure SELinux to allow `systemd` to load containers.

```
setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on
```

Enable and start the new service and reboot to verify it runs at boot.

```
sudo systemctl enable pi-hole.service
sudo systemctl start pi-hole.service
```

Access yoour Pi-Hole at `http://pi_hole_ip/admin`, login and see the magic happen :)

FInally I installed `cockpit-podman` package to keep track of this and future podman containers from [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/).

Please left any comments about your usage of pi-hole, experience with podman, etc.
