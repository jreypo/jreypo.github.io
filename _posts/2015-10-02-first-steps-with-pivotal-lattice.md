[**Lattice**](http://lattice.cf/) is the latest addition from [**Pivotal**](http://pivotal.io/) to its portfolio of open source projects. Lattice leverages various components from [**Cloud Foundry**](http://pivotal.io/platform), in order to run containerized workloads in a cluster.

- **Diego** - The new Cloud Foundry elastic runtime. Acts as an action-based scheduler and provides support for Docker images.
- **Doppler** - The log and metric aggregator for the platform and the running workloads.
- **Gorouter** - A software-based router with reverse proxy capabilities. Dynamically updated as the containers are spun up and down.

The first fact we need to understand about Lattice is that it is not intended to run production workloads. Instead Lattice is meant to be run on [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or VMware Fusion using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). In the end Lattice is an easy way to leverage all the power of Cloud Foundry for running containers, in your laptop and without having to bother about all Cloud Foundry installation details.

## Deploying Lattice

Installing and running Lattice in your laptop is relatively easy process, first of all we will need  First download the latest package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/releases) page for Lattice, there are packages available for Linux and OS X.

Unzip the package in a directory with the rest of your virtual machines.

```text
unzip lattice-bundle-v0.4.3-osx.zip
```

Now copy the `ltc` utility to a directory in your PATH, I always use `/usr/local/bin` for this kind of binaries.

## Running Lattice

Running Lattice should be quite simple, just change to `vagrant` directory on Lattice installation path, then execute `vagrant up` command and that's it. However there is a caveat, by default the Vagranfile will use the IP address 192.168.11.11 if `LATTICE_SYSTEM_IP` variable is not provided during the execution.

To avoid this issue pass `LATTICE_SYSTEM_IP` variable to Vagrant during the execution. I personally have used both [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) and [VMware AppCatalyst](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/devops/vmware-appcatalyst) but you can use Virtualbox too. For the AppCatalyst the only requirement is to have `appcatalyst-daemon` running since it is needed by the Vagrant provider.

```text
LATTICE_SYSTEM_IP=192.168.161.11 vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
```

With this we will have our Lattice instance up and running. Next we need to tell `ltc` how to connect to our Lattice instance, this operation is called targeting.

```text
ltc target 192.168.161.11.xip.io
```

With the API endpoint set let's deploy our first application, for this example we will use Lattice example app. Run the `ltc create` command with the name of the new app and the container to be spun up as the arguments.

Open your favorite browser and access `https://my-app.192.168.161.11.xip.io`.

The index indicates the node that we are accessing. Next we will scale up the application adding two additional containers. Use `ltc scale` to add additional instances of the app and `ltc status` to retrieve the status.

Another useful operation with `ltc` is the capacity to get the logs for your app.

```text

○ → ltc logs my-app
10/02 14:30:11.10 [APP|2] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 2
10/02 14:30:11.28 [APP|0] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 0
10/02 14:30:11.60 [APP|1] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 1
10/02 14:30:12.10 [APP|2] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 2
10/02 14:30:12.28 [APP|0] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 0
10/02 14:30:12.60 [APP|1] Lattice-app. Says Hello. on index: 1
```

I'll let you to add more apps to Lattice and to play around with `ltc`.

Comments are welcome, as always.

Juanma.
