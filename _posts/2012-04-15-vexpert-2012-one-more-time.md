[![](/images/vexpertlogo1.png "vExpert Logo")]({{site.url}}/images/vexpertlogo1.png) When I got home after a morning playing airsoft with some friends I found on my twitter stream a very nice surprise. My friend Josep Ros ([@josepros](https://twitter.com/#!/josepros)) was congratulating me for being awarded **VMware vExpert** for another year. **VMware** had
published the initial list in a blog post [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2012/04/announcing-vexpert-2012-title-holders.html).

I can't be thankful enough to [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) for including me again in such a great list of people and in special to John Troyer ([@jtroyer](https://twitter.com/#!/jtroyer)) and Alex Maier ([@lxmaier](https://twitter.com/#!/lxmaier)) for their excellent work leading this amazing community.

I also want to congratulate the rest of my fellow vExperts for the award, is a real honor to be on the same list. Please continue with your hard and inspirational work.

Juanma
