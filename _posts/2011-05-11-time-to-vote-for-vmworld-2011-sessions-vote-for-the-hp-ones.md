Time to vote for **VMworld 2011** sessions is here. Like every year **VMware** has opened the process to vote for those sessions that you want to make their way to the conference. To be able to vote you need to have a [vmworld.com](http://vmworld.com/) account, if don't have one the
registering process is very easy. The voting process is open until May
18th.

I checked the sessions at VMworld site and all look very interesting, you should review the complete list and vote for the ones you like the most. However I also want to see a deep HP presence in VMworld since I firmly believe that **[HP](www.hp.com)** has a lot to offer for VMware environments, also some of the most talented guys in the company have sent a bunch of damn good sessions for this VMworld, and because of that I compiled the following list which includes every session proposed by the HP folks. If you think like me please vote for their sessions.

**3005 - Designing and Building a Simple and Scalable Virtual Infrastructure with HP Flex-10 and ESX(i)**

Julian doesn't work for HP but without any doubt he can be considered an expert in both VMware and Virtual Connect Flex-10 and this session has the honor to be the only Flex-10 related session. You can get more details about the session in his blog where he wrote a [post](http://www.wooditwork.com/2011/05/10/want-to-see-hp-flex-10-and-esxi-at-vmworld-vote-for-session-3005/) about it.
