[OpenStack Rally](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally) is a benchmarking and testing project for OpenStack, it provides a framework for performance, scalability and stress tests. Rally can simulate different use-cases on an existing cloud.

Many OpenStack operation teams have Rally deployed in its own virtual machine and with all tests files in an external shared filesystem and versioned with git, which a totally valid and recommendable way of running your Rally tests. However running Rally from a Docker container has also unquestionable benefits:

- Portability - If like me you are always on the road and like to have an immutable rally environment always at hand.
- Integration with your CI/CD infrastructure, like Jenkins.

With the portability in mind I decided to do a learning exercise and dockerize my rally environment, which by the way was on a Centos 7 virtual machine running on VMware Fusion. Rally already provides a Dockerfile and building your own rally Docker container is as simple as:

```text
git clone https://github.com/openstack/rally.git
docker build -t rally-docker .
```

However this container is built using Ubuntu 16.04 as the base image and I prefer to use CentOS or Fedora. I have created and published a Docker container with all the Rally bits from RDO Mitaka repositories, if you just want to test it run the following command.

```text
docker run --name rally-mitaka -t -i -v ~/rally_home:/home/rally jreypo/rally-rdo-mitaka
```

To manually build the container clone my [Github repo](https://github.com/jreypo/rally-docker-containers), change to `rally-rdo-mitaka` directory and edit the Dockerfile to make any modifications to suit your needs.

```dockerfile

                which

VOLUME ["/home/rally"]
WORKDIR /home/rally

CMD ["bash", "--login"]
RUN rally-manage db create
```

Build and run the container.

```text
docker build -t jreypo/rally-rdo-mitaka .
docker run --name rally-mitaka -t -i -v ~/rally_home:/home/rally jreypo/rally-rdo-mitaka
```

Once you are in the container bash prompt create a deployment file called `deployment.json`

```json
{
    "type": "ExistingCloud",
    "auth_url": "http://172.16.98.7:5000/v2.0",
    "region_name": "RegionOne",
    "admin": {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "redhat",
        "tenant_name": "admin"
    }
}
```

Create the deployment with `rally` command line.

```text
[root@c82cd7302a9e rally]# rally deployment create --file=deployment.json --name=existing

HINTS:
* To get your cloud resources, run:
        rally show [flavors|images|keypairs|networks|secgroups]

* To use standard OpenStack clients, set up your env by running:
        source ~/.rally/openrc
  OpenStack clients are now configured, e.g run:
        glance image-list
[root@c82cd7302a9e rally]#
```

Test the connection between the rally container and your OpenStack installation by retrieving the configured flavors.

```text
[root@c82cd7302a9e rally]# rally show flavors

To run your first test create an execution file, you can grab one from the sample files in Rally repository. In my testing environment I am using the Nova scenario sample file `nova-boot-delete.json`. Launch the test with `rally` command line.

```text
[root@c82cd7302a9e ~]# rally task start nova_boot_delete.json

Input task is:

                }
            }

Task syntax is correct :)

Export your report in HTML format and store on the Docker volume attached to the container.

```text

Access the report from your browser.

As you can see running Rally from a Docker container is pretty easy, keep in mind that my Docker images are very opinionated towards RDO/Red Hat OpenStack releases although it should be valid to be used with any OpenStack distribution. Anyway if you want a more neutral container but still based on Fedora/CentOS I encourage you to use the one created by my colleague [Juanma Parrilla](https://twitter.com/kerbeross), you can check his Github repo [docker-osp-rally](https://github.com/padajuan/docker-osp-rally).
